Regulatory Simulator
--------------------

This is a regulatory simulator used to help support wireless technologies that
typically require some sort of kernels or userspace work. This work is entirely
in userspace and is distributed under the ISC permissive licensed in hopes that
any project can make use of it. The intent is to enable developers to contribute
to a framework to help test and advance regulatory code to enable communities
and developers to cherry pick code out to their own solutions, whether that be
in proprietary or open kernels, proprietary or open firmware, or even hardware,
whatever.

We follow the Signed-off-by tradition used in Linux kernel development to help
ensure we keep our files permissively licensed and that no one makes
contributions that they are not allowed to.

Signed-off-by meaning
---------------------

The Signed-off-by is defined by the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1
which is below:

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
